# silence_auction
A silent auction is an auction where bidders write down their bids privately, without an auctioneer. Bidders donâ€™t know how much others are offering. How it works: Items are displayed with their starting prices. Bidders write down their bids on a sheet or electronically. The highest bid wins when the auction ends.
